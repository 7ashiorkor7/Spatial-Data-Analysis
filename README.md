# Spatial-Data-Analysis
Spatial Data Analysis is the quantification of phenomena referenced in space. It is the study of methods to describe and explain a process that  operates in space based on a sample of observations taken at  particular locations. 

The R programming language is used. 

Key components of spatial analysis and spatial statistics:
* Visualization : Maps, graphical display
* Exploration : looking for patterns in data such as clusters and the behavior of events that are close in space or very distant.
* Modeling : Fitting models, testing hypothesis, formalizing spatial dependence

In this course, for various types of spatial data, the following were considered: 
* How to visualize the data, describe/evaluate any spatial pattern 
* How to choose an appropriate analysis and interpret the results
* How to predict values at new locations, which means we can draw a map 
* How to make inferences, accounting for spatially correlated observations 
* How to simulate spatial data 

Topics covered:
* Introduction; data types, visualization
* Geostatistical data, exploratory analysis
* Stationarity, Mean and covariance functions 
* Isotropy, Anisotropy, semivariogram 
* Spatial Regression
* Kriging (spatial prediction) 
* Non-stationarity, spatio-temporal
* spatial autocorrelation
* Spatial weights 
* Autoregressive models (SAR, CAR) 
* Point processes, Test of CSR, Fitting point process models 
* Multivariate spatial processes
